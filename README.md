# AI-Music-Generation

The aim is to generate new music using LSTM and given dataset.

1. Problem type :- Music Generation
2. Algorithm used :- LSTM
3. Dataset :- midi files
4. Libraries used :- Music21, Sci-kit Learn, Keras, Numpy, glob

(In the project, model was trained on Google Colab but the code was written on local machine therefore have manually loaded .hdf5 model on local machine once it was trained on cloud)
